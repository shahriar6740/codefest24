Orientation and Housing:
As we welcome our incoming graduate students to the university, we want to ensure a smooth transition into
academic life. The first semester is an exciting time filled with orientation activities, coursework, and
opportunities to engage with peers and faculty members.
Orientation days, scheduled between August 18th and 24th, will provide essential information about university
resources, academic expectations, and campus life. Additionally, students will embark on a journey of learning
and discovery through a diverse range of coursework, workshops, and seminars tailored to their respective fields
of study.
We understand the importance of securing comfortable housing accommodations. Our university offers
dormitory facilities with amenities such as shared kitchens, Wi-Fi access, and entertainment systems. However,
please note that dormitory allocation is based on admission date, and availability is limited to 200 seats across 4
dorms. Dormitory fees of $3,000 per semester are payable by August 15th to secure accommodation for the

We encourage all students to actively participate in orientation activities, engage with their peers, and take

Health Insurance Policy
At our university, the health and well-being of our students are of paramount importance. To ensure that all
students have access to essential healthcare services, we require each student to enroll in our comprehensive
health insurance policy valued at $500 for the academic year. This policy provides coverage for basic medical
needs, including doctor visits, prescription medications, and minor surgical procedures. In the event of any
health concerns or medical needs, students can seek medical attention from healthcare providers within our
network, and the costs will be covered by the insurance policy up to the specified limits.
It's important to note that while our health insurance policy offers coverage for a wide range of medical services,
there may be instances where students encounter complicated health conditions or require specialized treatments
beyond the scope of the policy. In such cases, students may be responsible for covering the additional costs
incurred for their healthcare needs. Additionally, our health insurance policy does not extend coverage for dental
or vision-related expenses, and students are encouraged to explore alternative options for these specific
healthcare needs.
In recognition of the significant impact of mental health on overall well-being, our health insurance policy
includes provisions for mental health support services. Students facing mental health challenges can access
counseling and therapy sessions free of charge by scheduling appointments with licensed mental healthprofessionals. We understand the importance of providing holistic support to our students and are committed to
promoting mental wellness alongside physical health.
By mandating the enrollment in our health insurance policy, we aim to safeguard the health and safety of our
student body, ensuring that they have access to quality healthcare services throughout their academic journey.
We believe that prioritizing preventive care and providing comprehensive health insurance coverage fosters a
supportive and thriving campus community where students can focus on their academic pursuits with peace of
mind.

accessible, ensuring that all students have the opportunity to pursue their athletic passions without financial
barriers.
In conclusion, the university's athletic program stands as a testament to its commitment to fostering a vibrant
and inclusive campus community, where students can pursue their athletic ambitions, develop lifelong skills,
and cultivate a passion for physical fitness and well-being. With access to world-class facilities, professionalcoaching staff, and a supportive community of fellow athletes, students have the resources they need to thrive in
both their academic and athletic pursuits. Whether they're shooting hoops on the basketball court, swimming
laps in the pool, or competing on the track, students at the university are empowered to reach their full potential
and achieve greatness in every aspect of their lives.
Course Registration Policy
At the beginning of each semester, students are required to register for courses through their student profile on
the university's online portal. The available courses for registration will be notified in the student profile, and
students are advised to register for their desired courses as soon as they become available. Early registration
ensures that students secure a spot in their preferred courses and helps in organizing class schedules effectively.
Students have the flexibility to make changes to their course registration up until the end of the third academic
week of the semester. During this period, students may add, drop, or swap courses without incurring any
financial penalties. However, any changes made to course registration after the third academic week may result
in financial penalties, and students may not receive a refund for the course fees deposited.
The passing grade for each course is set at 60%. Students are expected to meet the minimum passing grade to
successfully complete the course and earn credit towards their degree. In cases where a student does not achieve
the passing grade, they have the option to retake the same course in a subsequent semester to improve their
grade.
Retaking a course allows students the opportunity to strengthen their understanding of the course material and
improve their performance. However, students should be mindful of any academic policies regarding the
maximum number of attempts allowed for a particular course and any associated fees or restrictions.
It's important for students to carefully consider their course selections and academic goals when registering for
courses each semester. Academic advisors and faculty members are available to provide guidance and support to
students in selecting courses that align with their academic interests, career aspirations, and degree
requirements.
By adhering to the course registration policy outlined above, students can make informed decisions about their
academic journey, maximize their learning opportunities, and progress toward their educational goals
effectively. The university remains committed to supporting students throughout the course registration process
and ensuring a seamless academic experience for all.
